# polarization-ionization-gating-hhg

Fortran implementation of Lewenstein strong-field approximation model to simulate
high-harmonic generation (HHG) and isolated attosecond pulse generation for He atom
driven by orthogonally polarized combined fields.  (Demo version)

# polarization-ionization-gating-hhg

Two-step Fortran workflow:
1) **Program 1 (HHG)** generates high-harmonic spectrum data.
2) **Program 2 (IAP)** synthesizes an isolated attosecond pulse by superposing selected harmonics.
